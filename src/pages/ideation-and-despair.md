What do you do when you're already in trouble after receiving a box with smashed up pieces of the gingerbread house of your dreams? Of course there's nothing else to do but get cracking on a great idea to turn the tide. So what do you do with a semi-broken set of gingerbread house pieces? Try to repair it as neatly as possible, or maybe even buy a new set from IKEA?

The answer is neither. In a moment of madness, the idea of creating a mosaic house popped up and just moments later the hammer was brought out from the toolbox. Within a minute from getting the idea, the parts were now completely smashed and feelings of anxiety, regret and despair came creeping. The idea that seemed so great, turned out to only be a moment of madness, but now it was too late.
