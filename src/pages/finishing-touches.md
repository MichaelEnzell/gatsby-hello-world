The foundation is done, the house can actually stand by itself and it's no longer in 100 different pieces, time for some decorations to make it look less ugly! Given that Santa has been in quarantine most of the year and has put on quite a bit of weight, it was really important to make sure he could get up to the chimney in order for him to crawl down it with all the presents. So a ladder and a chimney platform was made to help him out a bit.

I also added some colored sweets to the roof, trying to somewhat make it look like christmas lights. Only issue when adding them was that I had to tilt the entire house, or my frosting (which at this point had pretty much given up on life) wouldn't hold them in place and everything would slide off. So my good friend Mr. Garlic Jar had to help out once more.

Those were the only finishing touches I had time or energy to make, leaving me with the <a href="/final-house">final house</a>.
