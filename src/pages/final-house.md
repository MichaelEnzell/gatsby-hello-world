At last my gingerbread house is complete, looks kinda crappy but taste pretty sweet</br>
Hopefully I will have learned something new, like skipping the frosting and go crazy with glue</br>
Next time I won't demolish my house with a hammer, or approach the task like a nerdy programmer</br>
Despite all the mishaps I did have some fun, but soon I will eat all my progress undone</br>

I gave my house a crack in a litteral sense, and now that it's finished christmas may commence</br>
I hope that you've all had a very good year, now lets make it better and pound a few beer
