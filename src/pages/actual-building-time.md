Now that the most important part of the project is done, the website, it's time to get cracking on the details of the project: building the gingerbread house. The first thing that needed to be done was repairing the mess I made earlier, so the parts had to be glued back together with frosting in order to get the mosaic effect I so desperately desired. It held up surprisingly well, however the result of the glued together parts looked less like a mosaic pattern and more like a bad painting made by spiderman.

Having all the parts repaired, it was time for the assembly. Turns out it's kinda tricky when doing it alone, so I had to take some help from some cups, a glass, a jar with garlic and a box of black beans to make sure the parts stayed in place while the icing hardened.

I figured that the house looked a bit boring, being just brown and white. Already having invested too much time on this project, I was kind of sick of it at this point, but at the same time I had to tie it all together with some <a href="/finishing-touches">finishing touches</a>.
